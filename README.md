Concept of three programming languages (python,c++,shell script)

# Comparison of three programming languages (C++, Python, Shell Script)
# Problem Description:
The aim of this assignment to read and search data from the given csv file. This file contains 
around 166750 rows of data. The implementation should be done using 3 programming 
languages. To made this assignment successful we have used C++ , Python and shell script . 
Firstly we implement the code to read the csv file and then searched data through the column ( 
Time , Account , Code , Country , Product, Value , Status ) of the data .
Characteristics:
❖ Readability,
❖ Writability, 
❖ Reliability, 
❖ Performance

# Readability
Readability in software programming can be defined by the ease with which the software is read 
and understood.

# C++ :
C++ is not an overall simple language which complicates its readability. In C++, a particular 
operation could be implemented in many ways. C++ supports user defined operator overloading 
which could cause confusion as a single operator symbol may have more than one meaning. 
Although overloading can aid readability, it can be harmful to readability as well. The lack of 
orthogonality affects C++’s readability . C++‘s names are case sensitive and does not specify a 
length limit on names which increases readability.. C++ has very good control structures, more 
flexible iteration statements and data type structures which help its readability. The abstraction 
data types in C++ make program easier to understand as abstraction increases expressivity and it 
ignores details and allows code to be re-used. In C++, the use of OOP also improves its 
readability of complicated concepts. Furthermore, C++’s enumeration types improve both readability and reliability because named values are easily to understand than coded values. Code 
readability is difficult in c++ as developer give more efforts to maintain and developing the c++ 
code . Code readability is easy in c++ as compared to shell script as it contains some logical 
things like- variable, operator which is easy to remember and understand.

# Python:
Python is successful on its readability. Code is clear and easy to understand. One of the reasons 
is that Python uses words for a few things that other languages use symbols for. Python is 
considered to be cleaner and more direct, with emphasis code readability. Python replace ifs with 
if / continue , places value for large number to make it more readable. Moreover, we can use 
inline statement to reduce confusion by having a syntax that is understandable in plain English 
(Fewer syntax rule) .Multiple variable can be assigned to define the function clearly. It is easy to 
maintain and develop . It is an object-oriented language. It is a platform-independent, scripted 
language, with complete access to operating system API's. It supports integration of complex 
solutions from pre-built components. It is a dynamic language, allowing more run-time 
flexibility than statically compiled languages. Python is a scripting language with full access to 
Operating System (OS) services. Consequently, Python can create high level solutions built up 
from other complete programs. Code readability is easy in python as compared to c++ many 
developers prefer python over any other language because it is easy to maintain and develop.

# Shell Script: 
Shell scripting language does not fit the classic definition of a useful language. If we want to 
shell scripts to be readable , we have to be treated shell as a real programming language. As , It 
does not have many of the features such as portability, facilities for resource intensive tasks such 
as recursion or hashing or sorting like most other real programming language. It does not have 
data structures like arrays and hash tables. It does not have facilities for direct access to hardware 
or good security features. Code readability is difficult in shell script as compared to c++ or any 
other high level language as it contains so many attributes to perform different task.

# Readability Comparison :
C++ is likely to be more readable than shell script but not more than 
python. 

# Writability
Writability is the measure of how easily a language can be used to create programs for a chosen 
problem domain.

# C++:
It is easier to write programs in C++ than to read programs written in C++. The reasons are C++ 
has rich data types and supports Page | 19 abstraction which improves its writability. C++ also 
has efficient expressivity provided by a rich set of operators which allows the programmers to 
solve the different/difficult problems with a very small program making it very writable. The 
powerful operator “++” makes variable increment written very convenient. For example, 
compare the notation count++ with count = count + 1, the former is more convenient than latter 
expression. C++ has very powerful, flexible and efficient control statements which improves its 
writability for solving complicated problems. C++ supports generic types, such as template, 
which has its advantage for improving writability. In terms of c++ is difficult to write as 
compared to python because java is static typed programming language. In terms of c++ difficult 
to write than shell script because as it requires long code to perform tasks than shell script.

# Python:
Python works based on the philosophy “There should be one and only one way to do it”. Syntax 
of python is very clutter free and it has multi-paradigm programming style to use to writing 
program. Python is an easy writing language with the ability for the function to return more than 
one parameter and we all how useful that is . Its automatic memory management allows us to 
write code without overflow or out or stack errors. From top to bottom that allows easy writing 
of the code . In terms of writability python again is easy to write it does not require too many 
attributes to code ex- variable need not to be declared first to use as it is dynamically typed 
programming language. Python strikes a good balance between fast compilation , readability and 
writability . Compared to C++ it takes less code to write.

# Shell Script:
Shell script is ahead of the other two programming. In terms of writability shell script easy to 
write than c++ because as it does not require long code like c++ to perform tasks. One can check
if file is writeable or not using the “-r” option.
Writability Comparison : Python is needs less code to write than C++ and shell needs less code 
than python and C++. So shell script is more writeable. Reliability 
Reliability is the probability that an item will perform a required function for a given period of time 
,under operating conditions . Simply, it is the probability of a non-failure over time .

# C++:
C++ is a dominant object-oriented programming language and it is reliable if a programmer uses 
it carefully. C++ focuses on flexibility and efficiency more than reliability, it is not a strongly 
typed and it does not have strict type checking which could reduce its reliability to some degree 
based on the facts that C++ supports unions type and it is an unsafe construct. C++ generally has 
more advantages in both readability and writability than disadvantages combined with its 
flexibility and efficiency for complicated software development. C++ is a reliable language.

# Python:
Python is reliable, speedy and efficient . One can work with and deploy python applications in 
nearly any platform . There’s little to no performance loss. We are not bound to a single platform 
or domain . It offers the same experience everywhere. In terms of reliabilty python is less reliable 
than c++.

# Shell Script: 
There is no doubt that shell is very less reliable than c++ as it can not use in 
software develovement and to perform other task as c++ and python do.
Note : If the algorithm is same for the three different programming language , C++ will be more 
reliable than python .But the performance and the reliability of the code can be improved by 
good algorithm. Generally , C++ have the most number of code lines compared to python and 
shell script. But all above performance matters.

# Performance
# C++:
In terms of reliability C++ is faster in speed as compared to python and shell script.
But in our assignment , To search data from csv file w.r to column “Value” and we take the input “1830”. And the 
execution time became 10.696 seconds . Total line number of the code in C++ is 262.
# Python:
In terms of reliability Python is slower in speed compared to C++.
But in our assignment , 
To search data from csv file w.r to column “Value” and we take the input “1830”. And the 
execution time became 7.23 seconds . Total line number of the code in Python is 87. 
# Shell Script:
In term of performance shell scripting is slower than c++ as they need to be interpreted and also
it slower then python.
But in our assignment , 
To search data from csv file w.r to column “Value” and we take the input “1830”. And the 
execution time became 5.29 seconds . Total line number of the code in Python is 42. 
So shell script code run faster than python and python code run faster than c++ .
